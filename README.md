Our workflow: At first we opened a JIRA project and divided the work between us. We decided as recommended in the project instructions that we will work both on the Android and web versions so we are knowledgeable in both. While working on the project Ahiya joined our group and divided the work with us.

In order to run the web version write npm start in the command line.

Foobar will open on the login page and you will have to press the create new account button and fill in valid details. Then you will be transferred Back to the login page where you can enter the details you signed up with and see the feed page. In the feed page you will see many posts and you can like, comment and share them. In addition to adding new comments you can also delete comments and edit them. Furthermore, you can add new posts of your own and edit and delete existing posts. There is also a possibility to move between light and dark modes and log out back to the login page.

Enjoy
