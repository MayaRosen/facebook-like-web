# **Facebook-Like React Website**

Welcome to the **Facebook React Website**! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a React-powered frontend designed to deliver an intuitive and interactive interface for a social media platform inspired by Facebook.

This project is part of a larger system that includes:
- [Android Frontend Repository](https://github.com/MayaRosen/facebook-like-android)
- [Backend Server Repository](https://github.com/MayaRosen/facebook-like-server)

Together, these repositories create a fully functional system for web and mobile platforms.

## **Development Journey**

- **Foundation:**  
  We started by crafting static webpage designs using **HTML** and **CSS** to establish a strong visual and structural foundation.

- **Transition to React:**  
  Building on the foundation, we migrated to **React**, utilizing its robust capabilities to create a **dynamic and responsive user experience**. By modularizing the interface into reusable components and efficiently managing states, we achieved smooth and seamless rendering.

- **Optimization:**  
  After thorough testing, we focused on refining the design and improving the user experience. The result is a polished, professional, and enjoyable interface for users.
